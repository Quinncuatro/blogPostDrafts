# How A Free Web3 Project is Helping Me Build a DAO on Solana

So back in 2017, I (and I imagine a LOT of other people on DEV.to) got really into cryptocurrencies. I made some beer money off Ethereum, followed some projects, and really dug into the kind of experiences blockchain technology was able to power.

Everyone I talked to seemed understandably smitten with the concept of decentralized finance, but I was trying to cut through the noise of all the day trading and trying to find where actual bedrock innovation was being made.

I sifted through a lot of altcoins and vaporware to find projects like Golem (a way for folks to rent spare computing cycles to artists who need to render their work), IOTA (a network built to handle IoT transactions), and Request Network (a suite of financial tools for crypto payments). These were teams that were bucking the trend of trying to make a boatload of money from ICOs and instead actually trying to change the way that we interact with the Internet. Something about these teams of people in the middle of one of the craziest bull runs of history saying "screw the quick money, what we're working on is "IMPORTANT" really stuck with me.

Then the bubble came up, the hype died out, and I pulled most of my (meager) investments out. I kept a loose eye on the space just to keep up to speed but didn't get too involved again.

Started looking into decentralization technology that wasn't on blockchain, as I didn't like what was going on with the rainforests. Found IPFS and started digging in on that.

Got back in, over the last few months as a buddy kept talking about Solana in our local tech Slack.

Found that it was non rainforest burning blockchain that just felt like using the internet, and transactiosn were CHEAP.

Flipped a SWITCH in me.

Caught a tweet from Nader Dabit about Dev_DAO, saw that I had enough Ether left in my wallet to cover the tx fee, and just yolo'd it.

The first few days of being part of a DAO of people just like me was wild. So many folks in the Discord just trying to learn web3 technologies and dump all that knowledge and energy back into a collectively owned and operated organization was a breath of fresh air.

I love my local tech group (of which I'm the president) but there's a certain amount of freedom in how a DAO allows everyone to make decisions and help shape the future of the thing. Not everything had to route through me and my team. People could contribute work, documentation, insights, or anything... whenever they had the time.

And helping the org comes back to helping yourself.

I distinctly remember sitting back and thinking of my crypto journey around 2017 where I was looking through projects trying to find innovative web experiences powered by blockchain that just didn't make sense using web2 technologies at the time. In 2021, amidst all of the NFT sales going on, I really and truly feel that this new community owned organization model is the killer app.

My friend helped me start digging into Solana projects that shared that same sense of community and I found groups that welcomed me with open arms and immediately made me feel like one of their own.

- [WGMI NFT Collector's Club](https://wgmi.cc/): A rad group of people doing a series of community art projects where buyers of their WGMI token get airdrops of NFTs that are part of interactive experiences throughout the year.

- [Nifty Nanas](https://www.niftynanas.com/): A community of wonderfully positive people who want to help support other projects in the Solana ecosystem.

- [Tech Folk](https://twitter.com/techfolk_nft): A team who's working on a neat looking project (that I honestly don't know much about yet) but have been great about helping me understand technical topics I'm not sure about.

And that's about when I remembered [a tweet from Jake](https://twitter.com/jake_burden_/status/1455549038527406084) from earlier in the month:

I've been wanting to find a way to get more involved in the crypto community and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. I have a few years of running a locally focused tech community, and to be quite honest - the members there were getting fed up with us talking about blockchain stuff.

So after hitting Jake up and letting him know that we can make this real, we jumped feetfirst into getting parts of it set up.

We set up a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ct3_dao), fleshed out a Discord server, and built a [rad website](https://ct3dao.io). We were talking behind the scenes about what direction we wanted to nudge this new community in before we started inviting people in, when I discovered buildspace.

Where before I was learning bits and pieces of projects I could pull together from the Solana ecosystem, now I could get my hands dirty with the real thing.

Bear in mind, we're still going to be using tools like Grape for account verification on our Discord and Sqds to handle on-chain voting.

But I was lowkey dreading having to roll my sleeves up and get dirty with the code to learn how any of it worked under the hood. If any of y'all have tried building a project with a new piece of tech, you know the documentation isn't always the best, if it's even there at all.

That's the vibe I've gotten from all of my forays into DApp development over the years: things are going to be messy and you're going to have to solve your own problems. Not a big deal, that's actually a great way to learn and make all those new ideas stick, but it's not always the most attractive first experience with a new tool.

The "Build a Web3 App on Solana with React and Rust" course (what does Farza want us to call these?) really helped me understand how the websites I've been using actually interacted with both my wallet and the Solana mainnet.

I knew the community management piece to get a group like this off the ground, but I was building a community to help people learn web3 development partly because I wanted to learn how to code for web3 projects. And buildspace really came in clutch.

BUT Y'ALL. THEN THEY DID IT AGAIN.

Right when Jake and I were starting to talk about how we wanted to handle minting (free) tokens to let people _officially_ be part of the community (and power the on-chain voting with SQDS), I realized I was less than a week out from another buildspace course on shipping a custom NFT collection on Solana with Metaplex.

Through my discussions with folks in WGMIcc and Nifty Nanas, I knew that Metaplex and Candy Machine were the move (especially since Jake and I wanted to do all of this on Solana). This course could not have come at a better time.

I actually had a need to learn how to do these things so that I could help out on a real deal project and buildspace was ready with content to walk me through a tutorial on how to do the exact thing.

I've seen people on Twitter talking about how they met folks through buildspace who ended up being cofounders of projects they put together and that it was super cool, but that's quickly becoming my reality. Imagine my surprise when they announced yesterday that they have another course coming up about building our own DAOs.

I mentioned that we were going to be utilizing SQDS but it's always good to know what's going on under the hood in case we need to build any custom additions later.

Jake and I had joked for a while about making a DAO to experiment with what a locally focused community owned organization might evolve. But it took a handful of things lining up in order to make it happen. Buildspace having content ready to teach me about Solana development with Anchor, NFT creation and minting with Metaplex, and about the underpinnings of a DAO structure all over the course of three weekends (albeit spread out a bit) really helps give me the knowledge and confidence I need to get this project over the finish line.

We were able to launch the website and finalize the Discord this Sunday night. While writing this article on Tuesday, we're already up to 30 local members talking about neat tools they find online, different projects they want to work on, and figuring out how we can connect with other local Makerspaces in order to help more Connecticut developers make the jump to web3.

I probably could have ground through learning all of this on my own, but dang if buildspace isn't the exact antithesis to my earlier point about documentation being rocky at best for new technologies. They really pushed me in the right direction.

---

Jake and I are just getting started with what we want to accomplish with CT3DAO, and I can't wait to write more technical posts about how we end up implemented everything we plan to build.

Until then, stay frosty.
